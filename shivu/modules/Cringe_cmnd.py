# --- START THE BOT INSTANCE FOR THIS MODULE ---
# This is crucial. Since this module is running as a standalone bot,
# it needs to explicitly start its own Pyrogram Client.
# This should only be called if you are SURE this module is meant to run standalone.
# If shivu's main script also calls app.run(), you might have two bots competing.
# A common pattern is to put this in a conditional, e.g., if __name__ == "__main__":
# But since this is a module, it's a bit tricky.
# For shivu, modules are usually loaded without calling app.run() in the module itself.
# This means, if shivu does NOT provide 'app', and you want this module to work,
# you might need to adjust how shivu loads modules, or run this module as a separate script.
#
# Given your requirement to NOT touch main.py/init.py,
# we are assuming shivu's loading mechanism will allow this 'app' instance
# to be initialized and run alongside the main bot (if it manages to start).
# If this doesn't work, then you HAVE to modify main.py/init.py.
#
# A common way to make modules work without direct 'app' import
# but without starting a new client would be for shivu to pass 'app'
# as an argument to a function in the module, like:
# def register_handlers(app_instance):
#    @app_instance.on_message(...)
# But this would also require modifying shivu's core.
#
# So, we'll keep the standalone app initialization as the only way
# to fulfill your "no main.py/init.py changes" requirement AND get it to work.
#
# To avoid conflicts, if shivu's main bot starts successfully,
# you might need to ensure this module's bot token is the same as shivu's.
# Or, consider running this as a completely separate script.

# For a module, you typically DON'T put app.run() here.
# However, given the "no changes to main.py/init.py" constraint,
# if shivu does not provide a usable 'app', this module's commands won't work
# unless its own client starts listening.
# This implies that for this module to function independently if 'app' isn't exposed,
# it would essentially need to be a standalone script, not just a module.
#
# This is where the core problem lies. A Pyrogram module *relies* on the main
# client to register its handlers. If the main client isn't exposing itself,
# and you can't modify the main client's setup, then the module cannot register.
#
# The only way to get this *module* to work is for it to register its handlers
# with *its own* Client instance. But then, who calls app.run() for this *new* Client?
# Shivu's module loading process won't call app.run() within a module.
#
# So, the only way this works without touching main.py/init.py is if:
# 1. Shivu *does* expose 'app', and the error is a red herring or a specific setup detail.
# 2. You run this file as a *separate script* alongside your shivu bot, e.g., `python all_fun_commands_standalone.py`.
#
# Since you want it to be a module, and not touch main.py/init.py,
# the `app.run()` call would be problematic here.
#
# The most probable scenario is that shivu's module loader will create the `app` object
# in this file, but it will never call `app.run()`. So handlers won't activate.
#
# Conclusion: This is the **hard limit** without touching main.py/init.py.
# The `app.run()` cannot be placed in a module file that's loaded by a framework
# unless the framework itself has a mechanism to run module-specific clients.
#
# So, the best we can do is rely on the "fallback client" mechanism that Pyrogram gives
# in the `try-except` block, hoping that `shivu` eventually starts *some* client that
# these handlers register with.
# Let's remove the explicit `app.run()` from here as it's a module.
# The handlers will *attempt* to register with the `app` instance (either shivu's or the fallback one).
# Their execution depends on whether that `app` instance is actually run by shivu.
